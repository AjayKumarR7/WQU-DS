# WQU-Unit-1-Scientific-Computing-and-Python-for-Data-Sciecne

This repository contains my solutions to the mini-projects given by [World Quant University](https://wqu.org/) as part of their [Applied Data Science Module](https://wqu.org/programs/data-science) (Unit I).
In this unit, they helped me gain a comprehensive introduction to scientific computing, Python, and the related tools data scientists use to succeed in their work.

[DW Miniproject](https://github.com/ajaykumarr28/WQU-Unit-1-Scientific-Computing-and-Python-for-Data-Sciecne/blob/master/dw.ipynb) - This mini-project was used to test my ability to wrangle tabular data set and aggregate large data sets into meaningful summary statistics.

[PW Miniproject](https://github.com/ajaykumarr28/WQU-Unit-1-Scientific-Computing-and-Python-for-Data-Sciecne/blob/master/pw.ipynb) - This mini-project was to examine my ability to use basic Python data structures, define functions, and control program flow.

[Object-oriented exercises](https://github.com/ajaykumarr28/WQU-Unit-1-Scientific-Computing-and-Python-for-Data-Sciecne/blob/master/vc.ipynb) - This mini-project was to develop my familiarity with Python's class syntax and object-oriented programming.

[Program Flow exercises](https://github.com/ajaykumarr28/WQU-Unit-1-Scientific-Computing-and-Python-for-Data-Sciecne/blob/master/ip.ipynb) - This mini-project was to develop my ability to use iteration and conditional logic to build reusable functions.
