# WQU-Unit-1-Scientific-Computing-and-Python-for-Data-Sciecne

This repository contains my solutions to the mini-projects given by World Quant University as part of their [Applied Data Science Module](https://wqu.org/programs/data-science) (Unit I).
In this unit, they helped me gain a comprehensive introduction to scientific computing, Python, and the related tools data scientists use to succeed in their work.
